# Mp3_Tag_Reader_and_Editor_for_ID3v2

Description: This project aims to develop a command-line tool for reading and editing ID3 tags of MP3 files. ID3 tags are metadata containers that store information about the MP3 file, such as the song title, artist, album, year, and genre.

Features Reading ID3v2 Tags: The tool will read the ID3v2 tags from an MP3 file and display the song's metadata information. Editing ID3v2 Tags: The tool will allow users to modify the metadata information and save the changes back to the MP3 file. Command-Line Interface: Users will interact with the tool via a command-line interface, providing the file name and desired operations as arguments.
